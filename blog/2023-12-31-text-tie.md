This is a little post I wanted to make about a tool I created...

I've been working on a CustomGPT model for Jungle to help developers with any questions they may have. CustomGPT's allow
you to upload knowledge files that help give the model context for the questions developers may ask.

All the docs used to build this site are markdown files, and the CustomGPT can't read from markdown files. This meant I 
had to manually convert **EACH AND EVERY** markdown file into a text file. This was a very tedious process and I wanted 
to automate it.

**My solution:** I created a tool called Text Tie to help me append all my docs together into a single text file that I
can easily upload. It allows me to append files are specific extensions into a single text file. This makes an hour long
process take two minutes.

Feel free to use it if you need, **it's open source and free to use**.
