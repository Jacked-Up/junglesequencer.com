Hey Everyone ðŸ‘‹, I'm so excited to announce that you can now sign up for the Jungle Sequencer Beta Program.

Jungle has been in the works for almost three years now. I've worked so hard to make it the best tool it can be. With
the official release around the corner, I want to get an edge on any bugs or issues I didn't catch. 

A tool of this size and complexity is bound to have some bugs. I've done my best to catch them all, but I'm sure there
are some that have slipped through the cracks.

That's where you come in. I need your help to make Jungle the best it can be. If you're interested in joining the beta
program, please fill out **[this form](https://forms.gle/55ZSyBrhH8iDoGKK8)**.

I'm looking for developers of all skill levels. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, I want to hear from you. I'm
looking for feedback on:
- The user interface
- The functionality
- The documentation
- And the overall experience.

The beta is a great opportunity to get a sneak peek at Jungle before anyone else. You'll also get to keep the version
you test for **free**.

I'm so excited to see what you all think. I can't wait to hear from you.

Happy coding! ðŸŒ´
