CustomGPT\'s allow\\r\\nyou to upload knowledge files that help give the model context for the questions developers may ask.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the docs used to build this site are markdown files, and the CustomGPT can\'t read from markdown files. This meant I \\r\\nhad to manually convert **EACH AND EVERY** markdown file into a text file. This was a very tedious process and I wanted \\r\\nto automate it.\\r\\n\\r\\n**My solution:** I created a tool called Text Tie to help me append all my docs together into a single text file that I\\r\\ncan easily upload. It allows me to append files are specific extensions into a single text file. This makes an hour long\\r\\nprocess take two minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeel free to use it if you need, **it\'s open source and free to use**.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Download it [here](https://github.com/JackaPacka/Text-Tie/releases/tag/Release).\\r\\n\\r\\n![Text Tie app](https://i.imgur.com/6JtGLyQ.png)"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-12-first-blog-post.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Hey \ud83d\udc4b, I\'m Jack Randolph, also known as JackaPacka.

I\'m the creator of Jungle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is my first time ever blogging. I figured I would use this place to share change logs, announcements, and updates\\r\\nregarding Jungle. If you\'re reading this, I can\'t thank you enough! Honestly, I\'ve never followed another developer\'s\\r\\nblog myself, so knowing you\'re here reading mine is incredibly meaningful to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ve been working on Jungle for the past three plus years. It has been a huge passion project for me. I\'m so happy \\r\\n(and quite nervous) to finally get it out into the hands of developers. I cannot wait to see what you all create!\\r\\n\\r\\nJungle originally started as a tiny little tool for a game I was working on. I needed a tool that could help me create\\r\\ndialog trees, missions, boss battles, and cinematics/animations more easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent only about a week developing the first version of Jungle. It was very bare bones compared to what Jungle is \\r\\ntoday. Even being as bare bones as it was, the tool was still **INCREDIBLY** useful. I kept on developing it alongside\\r\\nmy game, and it just got better and better.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, I started working on my recreation of the hit game Iron Long inside virtual reality. I used Jungle to handle all \\r\\nthe animations and cinematics in the game. You can check out my remake [here](https://jackaapacka.itch.io/iron-lung-vr).\\r\\nThis proved to me that Jungle could work in a shipped product.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery aspect of Jungle has been meticulously designed to ensure it\'s the best tool possible. I truly hope you enjoy\\r\\nusing Jungle as much as I loved creating it!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo long for now,\\r\\n<br/>**Jack Randolph**"}]}')}}]);
