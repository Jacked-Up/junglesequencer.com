            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jack Randolph, also known as JackaPacka. I'm the creator of Jungle.</p>
<p>This is my first time ever blogging. I figured I would use this place to share change logs, announcements, and updates
regarding Jungle. If you're reading this, I can't thank you enough! Honestly, I've never followed another developer's
blog myself, so knowing you're here reading mine is incredibly meaningful to me.</p>
<p>I've been working on Jungle for the past three plus years. It has been a huge passion project for me. I'm so happy
(and quite nervous) to finally get it out into the hands of developers. I cannot wait to see what you all create!</p>
<p>Jungle originally started as a tiny little tool for a game I was working on. I needed a tool that could help me create
dialog trees, missions, boss battles, and cinematics/animations more easily.</p>
<p>I spent only about a week developing the first version of Jungle. It was very bare bones compared to what Jungle is
today. Even being as bare bones as it was, the tool was still <strong>INCREDIBLY</strong> useful. I kept on developing it alongside
my game, and it just got better and better.</p>
<p>Then, I started working on my recreation of the hit game Iron Long inside virtual reality. I used Jungle to handle all
the animations and cinematics in the game. You can check out my remake <a href="https://jackaapacka.itch.io/iron-lung-vr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
This proved to me that Jungle could work in a shipped product.</p>
<p>Every aspect of Jungle has been meticulously designed to ensure it's the best tool possible. I truly hope you enjoy
using Jungle as much as I loved creating it!</p>
<p>So long for now,
<br><strong>Jack Randolph</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>
