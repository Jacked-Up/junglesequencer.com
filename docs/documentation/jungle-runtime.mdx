The Jungle runtime is a multi-script system. It's essentially every part of the framework that is built directly into
the application. The runtime is designed in a way where the entire editor system could be stripped from the project and
the framework would still function.

You should **NEVER** need to interact with the runtime directly. Jungle is designed to manage the runtime systems all
automatically.

## Systems

The runtime systems start at the `JungleTree` class. This class acts as the container for sequences and is responsible
for not only playing the sequence but also managing the creation, deletion, and execution of nodes.

The `JungleNode` class is an extendable container for functions and behaviors. Nodes also manage their connections and
disconnections.

The `JungleRuntime` class itself is simply a `MonoBehaviour` that listens for Unity events and passes them to the trees.

## Lifecycle

The runtime will always automatically create the game object named "[Jungle Runtime]" and throw it into the
"DontDestroyOnLoad" scene.

The game object contains a script named `JungleRuntime` that is used to listen for Unity MonoBehaviour event actions
such as the `Update` and `FixedUpdate` events.

:::warning WARNING
Do not delete the "[Jungle Runtime]" game object from the scene. It is required for the framework to function.
