Welcome to the Jungle Sequencer documentation!

## Where to Start

Jungle can be a bit overwhelming at first. Just know that by the time you get the hang of everything, Jungle will be
your best friend!

Here's the steps we recommend taking to get started:
- Start by reading about the [Jungle Editor](/docs/using-the-editor/jungle-editor) and how to use it.
- Next, read about [Jungle Nodes](/docs/jungle-nodes) and how to create your own.
- Finally, read about [Jungle Trees](/docs/jungle-tree) and how to create your own.

Additionally, you can learn about our extra features:
- Quickly debug and fix your tree with the [Jungle Validator](/docs/using-the-editor/jungle-validator).
- Learn how to further customize your node inspectors with
  [Custom Node Editors](/docs/jungle-nodes/advanced/custom-node-inspectors).
