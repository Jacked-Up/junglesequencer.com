Creating your own nodes in Jungle is a breeze. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new node in
each variant. Before beginning, it's important to make sure you have a good understanding of why you should create nodes
in the first place.

#### LEGO Analogy

Think of nodes as LEGO blocks. Each block is a small piece of a larger set. Each block should be able to be used in as
many different sets as possible. This is the same for nodes. Each node should be able to be used in as many trees as 
possible.

If a LEGO block was too specific and only made sense in one set, it wouldn't be very useful. The same goes for nodes.
Always make sure to split your tasks into separate, modular nodes.

## Node Variants

Jungle has four node variants to choose from. Each variant has its own unique use case, but they all work the same way.

Choosing the right variant for your node is important. Here's a quick overview of each variant:
- **Branch Node:** A node with one input and multiple outputs.
- **IO Node:** A node with one input and one output.
- **Generic Node:** A node with one input and one output, but the input and output type can be anything.
- **Event Node:** A node with no inputs and multiple outputs.

#### But What if I Want More Than One Input?

If your node needs multiple inputs, more than likely, you're likely using Jungle in the wrong way. Due to how the Jungle
runtime works, as soon as a node is started, all port call data should be available.

While it would be totally possible to implement another parameter to the `OnStart` method that could explicitly mark the
inputted data and mark which input it came from, this would make Jungle more of a visual scripter than a sequencer.

:::tip PASSING MULTIPLE VALUES THROUGH A SINGLE PORT
If you just want to pass multiple values through the same port, you can always just use a
