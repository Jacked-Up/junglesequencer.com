Jungle is very strict about deleting node scripts. This is due to limitations with the Unity Asset Database and how it
handles sub-assets. Jungle has safeguards in place to prevent nodes from losing metadata and serialized data when nodes
go missing or are deleted via the file system.

:::warning DO NOT DELETE NODE SCRIPTS VIA THE FILE SYSTEM
If you delete a node script from your file system, Jungle cannot detect the change and will not be able to perform 
important clean up on your trees. This can lead to a lot of issues and is **NEVER** recommended.
:::

## Deleting Node Scripts

You have two options when it comes to deleting node scripts:
- Mark the node as deprecated
- Delete the node script manually via the Unity Assets window

### Marking a Node as Deprecated

You can mark a node as deprecated by setting the `Deprecated` property in the node properties attribute to `true`. This
will mark every instance of the node in the Jungle Validator. This makes it easy to find and replace the node with a new 
one.

Marking a node as deprecated will also remove the node from the explorer so that it can no longer be added to trees.

#### Steps
- Open the node script in your code editor
- Set the `Deprecated` property to `true` in the node properties attribute

### Deleting Node Scripts Manually

You can delete node scripts manually from the Unity Assets window. Jungle will detect this action and prompt you asking
if you're sure you want to remove all instances of the nodes from all the tree in the project.

#### Steps
- Locate the node script in the Unity Assets window
- Then you can:
  - Right-click the node script and select `Delete` from the context menu
  - Press the `Delete` key on your keyboard while the node script is selected

This will remove every instance of the node from all trees in the project. This includes all connections, all the node 
metadata, and all the serialized data for the node instances.

:::warning WARNING
This approach is **NOT** reversible and will remove all instances of the node, all connections, all the metadata, and 
all the serialized data for the node instances.

**Make sure to back up your project before doing this.**
