Here's the steps we recommend taking to get started:
- Start by reading about the [Jungle Editor](/docs/using-the-editor/jungle-editor) and how to use it.
- Next, read about [Jungle Nodes](/docs/jungle-nodes) and how to create your own.
- Finally, read about [Jungle Trees](/docs/jungle-tree) and how to create your own.

Additionally, you can learn about our extra features:
- Quickly debug and fix your tree with the [Jungle Validator](/docs/using-the-editor/jungle-validator).
- Learn how to further customize your node inspectors with
[Custom Node Editors](/docs/jungle-nodes/advanced/custom-node-inspectors).
